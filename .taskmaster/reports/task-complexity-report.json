			"taskTitle": "Define Standard Documentation Template and Structure",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task of defining the standard documentation template into subtasks: 1. Draft initial template sections based on PRD. 2. Review draft template against all PRD requirements (Documentation, Quality). 3. Incorporate feedback and refine sections for clarity and comprehensiveness. 4.
