# Task ID: 36
# Title: Implement Automated Documentation Validation System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop an automated system to validate documentation quality, including markdown link checking, template compliance, and CI/CD integration to prevent documentation decay.
# Details:
1. **Markdown Link Checker Implementation:**
   - Research and select a suitable markdown link checking tool or library (e.g., `markdown-link-check`, `lychee`, or a custom script using Python libraries like `requests` and `beautifulsoup` or `markdown-it-py`).
   - Configure the tool to recursively scan all markdown files within the `_documentation/` directory.
   - Ensure the checker validates both internal relative links (to other documents or sections) and external absolute URLs.
   - Implement mechanisms to handle or ignore links requiring authentication if full checking is not feasible, or configure necessary credentials securely if it is.
   - Allow configuration for retries and timeouts for external links.

2. **Template Compliance Validator Development:**
   - Define a set of rules based on the standard documentation template established in Task 2. These rules should verify:
     - Presence of all mandatory sections (e.g., "Overview & Purpose", "Key Files & Subdirectories", "Security Implications").
     - Correct formatting and naming of section headers.
     - Adherence to any specified structural requirements within sections (e.g., use of lists, code blocks for specific information).
   - Develop scripts (e.g., Python with a markdown parsing library like `mistune` or `CommonMark`) to parse markdown files and enforce these template rules.
   - The validator must output clear, actionable error messages indicating the file, line number (if possible), and nature of the template deviation.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:**
   - Integrate both the markdown link checker and the template compliance validator into the project's Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
   - Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger these validation checks automatically on every commit to feature branches and/or on every pull request targeting the main documentation branch.
   - Ensure that the CI/CD build fails if either the link checker or the template validator reports errors, thus preventing the merge of non-compliant documentation.
   - CI/CD logs should clearly display the output from the validation tools, making it easy for authors to identify and fix issues.

4. **Configuration and Customization:**
   - Allow for configuration of the validation tools (e.g., allowlisting certain URLs for the link checker, defining severity levels for template violations).
   - Store configurations in a version-controlled file (e.g., YAML, JSON).

5. **Documentation for the Validation System:**
   - Create documentation for the automated validation system itself.
   - This documentation should explain how to run the validation tools locally for pre-commit checks.
   - Detail the CI/CD integration, how to interpret validation failures, and common troubleshooting steps.
   - Provide guidance on fixing common validation errors reported by the system.

# Test Strategy:
1. **Markdown Link Checker Verification:**
   - Create a set of test markdown files within a dedicated test directory.
   - Include files with:
     - Valid internal relative links.
     - Valid external URLs (HTTP and HTTPS).
     - Broken internal links (pointing to non-existent files or anchors).
     - Broken external URLs (e.g., 404 Not Found, DNS resolution failure).
     - Links to resources that might require special handling (e.g., redirects, authentication - if supported).
   - Execute the link checker against these test files and verify that it accurately identifies all broken links and passes all valid ones, reporting as expected.

2. **Template Compliance Validator Verification:**
   - Create test markdown files that:
     - Perfectly adhere to the standard documentation template (from Task 2).
     - Violate template rules by missing one or more mandatory sections.
     - Contain incorrectly formatted or misspelled section headers.
     - Deviate from any defined structural expectations within sections.
   - Run the template compliance validator against these test files. Verify that it correctly identifies all instances of non-compliance and passes compliant files, with error messages clearly pointing to the issues.

3. **CI/CD Integration Test:**
   - Create a feature branch and make documentation changes that intentionally introduce:
     - At least one broken link.
     - At least one template compliance issue.
   - Push the changes and create a pull request (or trigger the CI pipeline as configured).
   - Verify that the CI/CD pipeline executes the validation checks and correctly fails the build, clearly reporting the specific errors from both the link checker and template validator.
   - Create a subsequent commit on the same branch that fixes all reported issues.
   - Push the fixes and verify that the CI/CD pipeline now runs successfully and the build passes.

4. **Reporting and Usability Testing:**
   - Review the error messages and reports generated by both validators (locally and in CI/CD logs) for clarity, accuracy, and actionability. Ensure they provide enough information for a user to easily locate and fix the problem.

5. **Documentation Review for Validation System:**
   - Review the documentation created for the automated validation system itself. Verify its completeness, accuracy, and clarity in explaining how to use the tools and interpret results.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Markdown Link Checker [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop and configure a tool to automatically check for broken links (both internal and external) within all markdown files in the `_documentation/` directory.
### Details:
1. Research and select a suitable markdown link checking tool (e.g., `markdown-link-check`, `lychee`) or develop a custom script (e.g., Python with `requests`, `beautifulsoup`, or `markdown-it-py`).
2. Configure the chosen tool to recursively scan all `.md` files within the `_documentation/` directory.
3. Ensure the checker validates both internal relative links (to other documents or sections) and external absolute URLs.
4. Implement strategies for handling links requiring authentication (e.g., ignore them, or configure necessary credentials securely if feasible and required).
5. Allow configuration for retries and timeouts for external link checks to handle network flakiness.
6. The checker should output a clear report of broken links, including the file path and line number if possible.

## 2. Develop Documentation Template Compliance Validator [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create scripts to parse markdown documentation files and verify their adherence to predefined template standards, ensuring structural consistency and presence of mandatory sections.
### Details:
1. Define a comprehensive set of rules based on the established documentation template (as per Task 2, e.g., presence of "Overview & Purpose", "Key Files & Subdirectories", "Security Implications").
2. Rules should cover: presence of all mandatory sections, correct formatting and naming of section headers, and adherence to specified structural requirements within sections (e.g., use of lists, code blocks for specific information).
3. Develop scripts (e.g., using Python with a markdown parsing library like `mistune` or `CommonMark`) to parse markdown files and enforce these template rules.
4. The validator must output clear, actionable error messages indicating the file, line number (if possible), and the specific nature of the template deviation.

## 3. Integrate Validators into CI/CD Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 36.1, 36.2
### Description: Set up the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automatically run both the markdown link checker and the template compliance validator on relevant code changes, failing the build if documentation issues are found.
### Details:
1. Integrate the markdown link checker (from subtask 1) and the template compliance validator (from subtask 2) into the project's CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins).
2. Configure the CI/CD pipeline to trigger these validation checks automatically on every commit to feature branches and/or on every pull request targeting the main documentation branch.
3. Ensure that the CI/CD build fails if either the link checker or the template validator reports errors, thus preventing the merge of non-compliant documentation.
4. CI/CD logs should clearly display the output from both validation tools, making it easy for authors to identify and fix issues.

## 4. Implement Configuration Management and Document the Validation System [done]
### Dependencies: 36.3
### Description: Develop a flexible configuration mechanism for the validation tools and create comprehensive documentation for using, maintaining, and troubleshooting the automated documentation validation system.
### Details:
1. **Configuration Management:**
   - Design and implement a system to allow configuration of the validation tools (e.g., allowlisting specific URLs or domains for the link checker, defining severity levels for template violations, enabling/disabling specific template rules).
   - Store these configurations in a version-controlled file (e.g., YAML, JSON) that is easy for users to understand and modify.
   - Ensure both the link checker and template validator read their configurations from this central file.
2. **System Documentation:**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the automated validation system itself.
   - Explain how to run the validation tools locally for pre-commit checks by developers.
   - Detail the CI/CD integration: how it works, how to interpret validation failures from CI logs.
   - Provide common troubleshooting steps and guidance on fixing common validation errors reported by the system (e.g., how to add a URL to the allowlist, how to fix common template issues).
   - Document how to update or extend the validation rules or configurations.
