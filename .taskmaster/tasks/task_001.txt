# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize Project and Setup Analysis Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the project structure, version control (Git), and configure analysis tools (MCP Zen, Gemini Pro, Task Master) as per PRD. Define initial task breakdown in Task Master.
# Details:
Create a central project directory. Initialize a Git repository for version control of documentation and analysis scripts. Install and configure MCP Zen tools for system analysis. Ensure access to Gemini Pro for advanced analysis capabilities. Set up Task Master (or chosen task management tool) and import the initial high-level tasks. Perform web searches for best practices in documenting embedded Linux systems and SRM-like devices.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Git repository is functional. Confirm MCP Zen tools and Gemini Pro access are operational. Task Master is set up with initial tasks. Basic project structure is in place.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Project Directory and Git Repository [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the main project folder structure and initialize a new Git repository within it for version control, based on the first major component.
### Details:
Define project naming convention. Create standard subdirectories (e.g., /src, /docs, /tests). Initialize Git with a .gitignore file appropriate for the project type.

## 2. Install and Configure MCP Zen Tools [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install the MCP Zen toolset and configure it according to project requirements and best practices, as per the second major component.
### Details:
Follow official MCP Zen documentation for installation. Configure any project-specific settings, licenses, or integrations. Store configuration files within the project structure if applicable.

## 3. Ensure Gemini Pro Access and Setup [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Verify access to Gemini Pro API or platform and configure any necessary API keys, SDKs, or environment variables for integration, addressing the third major component.
### Details:
Verify Gemini Pro account status and access credentials. Obtain API key if needed. Set up environment variables or configuration files securely, potentially using a .env file managed by .gitignore.

## 4. Set Up Task Master and Import Initial Tasks [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install or configure the chosen Task Master application/tool and populate it with the initial set of project tasks, fulfilling the fourth major component.
### Details:
Select or confirm the Task Master tool to be used. Configure the project within Task Master. Prepare and import the initial task list derived from project planning or the prompt itself.

## 5. Conduct Initial Web Searches for Best Practices [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Perform web searches to identify and document best practices related to the project's core components (Git, MCP Zen, Gemini Pro, Task Master) and overall development workflow, as outlined in the fifth component.
### Details:
Research best practices for: project structuring, Git branching models, efficient use of MCP Zen tools, secure Gemini Pro API integration, and effective task management strategies. Document key findings and resources in the project's documentation folder.
