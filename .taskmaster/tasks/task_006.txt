# Task ID: 6
# Title: Analyze and Document Network Services and Daemons
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Identify, analyze, and document all network services and daemons, including their configurations, ports, protocols, startup scripts, and integration points. Produce a Network Services Inventory.
# Details:
Locate service configuration files (primarily in /etc, /usr/local/etc) and startup scripts (e.g., in /etc/init.d, or systemd unit files if used). For each service (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS server, DNS resolver/proxy, DHCP server/client, NTP, SSH, VPNs), document its purpose, key configuration files and parameters, default ports, protocols used, and security considerations (authentication, encryption). Use MCP Zen tools and netstat/ss (if analyzing a live similar system for context) to identify listening services. Compile this into a Network Services Inventory deliverable using the standard template (Task 2).

# Test Strategy:
Verify the Network Services Inventory is complete and accurate. Documentation for each service should cover configuration, security, operational aspects, and adherence to the template. Cross-check with /etc documentation (Task 3).
