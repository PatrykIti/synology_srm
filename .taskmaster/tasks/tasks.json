For standard /usr subdirectories (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib, /usr/share):\n    a.

        "description": "Perform a system-wide cross-reference analysis of all documented directories using Zen MCP and Gemini Pro to identify inter-component dependencies, data flows, integration points, and security vulnerabilities. Consolidate findings into comprehensive system architecture documentation.",
        "details": "This task involves a holistic analysis of the SRM system, building upon the detailed documentation of individual directories. The primary goal is to map out the interconnections and overall architecture.\n1.  **Input Consolidation:** Gather all existing analysis documentation for system directories (from tasks such as 3, 7, 8, 9, 14, 26, 27, 28, 29).\n2.  **Tool Utilization:** Employ Zen MCP and Gemini Pro for advanced analysis capabilities. These tools will be used to:\n    *   Trace execution paths between components (e.g., how a service in /usr/sbin uses libraries from /usr/lib and configurations from /etc).\n    *   Analyze communication mechanisms (e.g., sockets in /run, shared files, IPC).\n    *   Cross-reference configurations with their runtime effects.\n3.  **Analysis Focus Areas:**\n    *   **Inter-Component Dependencies:** Map dependencies between binaries, libraries, scripts, configuration files, and services across different directories. Identify critical paths and single points of failure.\n    *   **Data Flow Analysis:** Document how data is ingested, processed, stored, and transmitted within the system. This includes user data, system logs, configuration data, and operational metrics.\n    *   **Integration Points:** Clearly define and document key interfaces and integration points between major system components and any third-party services.\n    *   **Security Vulnerability Identification (Cross-Cutting):** Building on the findings of Task 5 (Comprehensive Security Analysis Report), analyze how identified vulnerabilities might be exploited through component interactions. Identify new potential vulnerabilities that emerge from the way components are integrated or how data flows between them.\n4.  **Architecture Documentation:**\n    *   Produce a comprehensive document (or set of documents/diagrams) that describes the overall system architecture.\n    *   Utilize visual aids such as dependency graphs, data flow diagrams, and component interaction diagrams to illustrate the architecture.\n    *   This documentation should serve as a central reference for understanding the SRM system as a whole, linking back to detailed documentation of individual components.\n    *   Ensure adherence to the standard documentation template (Task 2) for any new summary documents produced.",
        "testStrategy": "1.  **Coverage Review:** Verify that the cross-reference analysis encompasses all major system areas and components documented in the prerequisite tasks.\n2.  **Accuracy of Mappings:** Peer review the documented dependencies, data flows, and integration points for technical accuracy. Spot-check several key interaction chains.\n3.  **Security Insights:** Confirm that the analysis provides meaningful insights into security vulnerabilities from an architectural perspective, consistent with and expanding upon Task 5.\n4.  **Documentation Quality:** Assess the clarity, completeness, and usability of the final system architecture documentation. Diagrams must be accurate and easy to understand.\n5.  **Tool Usage Verification:** Confirm that Zen MCP and Gemini Pro were effectively utilized to perform the cross-reference analysis and generate insights.\n6.  **Cross-Reference Integrity:** Ensure that the architecture documentation correctly links to and references the detailed documentation of individual directories and components.",

        "description": "Update all existing Markdown documents in `_documentation/structure/` to include standardized top and bottom navigation links (Table of Contents, Previous, Next) according to a predefined sequence and the template from Task 24.",
        "details": "This task involves updating all Markdown files currently residing in the `_documentation/structure/` directory (e.g., `bin.md`, `sbin.md`, `etc.md`, `lib.md`, `usr.md`, `var.md`, `etc.defaults.md`, `var.defaults.md`, and others) to incorporate consistent navigation elements.\n\n1.  **Identify Target Files**: Locate all `.md` files within the `_documentation/structure/` directory.\n2.  **Establish Document Order**: Create a definitive sequence for all identified files. The order is:\n    *   `bin.md`\n    *   `sbin.md`\n    *   `etc.md`\n    *   `lib.md`\n    *   `usr.md`\n    *   `var.md`\n    *   `etc.defaults.md`\n    *   `var.defaults.md`\n    *   Followed by any remaining `.md` files from `_documentation/structure/`, sorted alphabetically by their filenames.\n3.  **Update Each Document**: For every file in the established sequence:\n    *   Determine its predecessor and successor document based on the sequence. The display name for link text (e.g., `{Poprzedni Nazwa}` or `{Następna Nazwa}`) should be the filename without the `.md` extension (e.g., 'bin' for `bin.md`, 'sbin' for `sbin.md`).\n    *   Drawing from the navigation structure defined in Task 24, insert/update two identical navigation sections: one at the very top of the document content and one at the very bottom.\n    *   Each navigation section must contain:\n        *   A link to the main table of contents: `[← Powrót do spisu treści](../README.md)`. This link points to `_documentation/README.md` (created by Task 23).\n        *   A link to the previous document: `[← Poprzedni dokument: {Poprzedni Nazwa}](./{poprzedni_plik}.md)`. If the current document is the first in the overall sequence, this link should be omitted or replaced with a placeholder like '---' as per Task 24 guidelines.\n        *   A link to the next document: `[Następny dokument: {Następna Nazwa} →](./{następna_plik}.md)`. If the current document is the last in the overall sequence, this link should be omitted or replaced with a placeholder like '---' as per Task 24 guidelines.\n    *   Ensure all relative links for previous (`./{poprzedni_plik}.md`) and next (`./{następna_plik}.md`) documents correctly point to sibling files within the `_documentation/structure/` directory.",
        "testStrategy": "1.  Retrieve all `.md` files from the `_documentation/structure/` directory after the task is completed.\n2.  For each retrieved Markdown file, perform the following checks:\n    a.  Verify the presence of a navigation bar at the absolute top of the file content and an identical navigation bar at the absolute bottom.\n    b.  Confirm that the 'Powrót do spisu treści' link in both navigation bars correctly points to `../README.md`.\n    c.  Validate that the 'Poprzedni dokument' and 'Następny dokument' links (or their placeholders) are accurate according to the specified document sequence: `bin.md` → `sbin.md` → `etc.md` → `lib.md` → `usr.md` → `var.md` → `etc.defaults.md` → `var.defaults.md`, followed by all other `.md` files from the directory sorted alphabetically.\n    d.  Ensure the display text for 'Poprzedni dokument' and 'Następny dokument' links correctly uses the filename (without the `.md` extension) of the linked document (e.g., 'sbin' for `sbin.md`).\n    e.  Confirm that the first document in the sequence (e.g., `bin.md`) appropriately omits the 'Poprzedni dokument' link or uses the agreed-upon placeholder.\n    f.  Confirm that the last document in the overall sequence appropriately omits the 'Następny dokument' link or uses the agreed-upon placeholder.\n    g.  Verify that all relative file paths in the 'Poprzedni dokument' and 'Następny dokument' links (e.g., `./sbin.md`) correctly resolve to other files within the `_documentation/structure/` directory.\n3.
