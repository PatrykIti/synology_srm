# Task ID: 25
# Title: Update Main Project README.md with Documentation Section and Project Overview
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 23
# Priority: medium
# Description: Modify the root README.md file to incorporate a dedicated section for system documentation, linking to _documentation/README.md. The update should also include a project overview, the current status of the system analysis, and ensure easy navigation to detailed documentation resources.
# Details:
1. Access the root `README.md` file of the project.
2. Review the existing content and structure to ensure new sections are integrated harmoniously.
3. Implement a "Project Overview" section: This section should concisely define the project's main objective (e.g., "Comprehensive analysis and documentation of the SRM firmware/system internals") and its scope.
4. Implement an "Analysis Status" section: This section should provide a high-level summary of the documentation and analysis progress. Initially, it can state that the analysis is ongoing and will be updated as major milestones are reached. Mention key areas if possible (e.g., "Core system components analysis in progress, network services documentation underway").
5. Implement a "System Documentation Hub" section:
    a. Add a prominent link to the central documentation entry point: `[Access Full System Documentation](./_documentation/README.md)`.
    b. Include a brief explanation that this link leads to an organized collection of detailed documents covering various aspects of the SRM system.
6. Ensure the overall `README.md` maintains a clear, professional, and welcoming tone for anyone exploring the project.
7. Verify that all links are relative and correct, ensuring they will work in a cloned repository.
8. Commit the updated `README.md` to version control.

# Test Strategy:
1. Clone the repository to a fresh location or view the raw `README.md` file.
2. Confirm the "Project Overview" section is present and clearly articulates the project's purpose.
3. Verify the "Analysis Status" section exists and provides a relevant, albeit potentially general, status.
4. Locate the "System Documentation Hub" section.
    a. Confirm the link text is descriptive (e.g., "Access Full System Documentation").
    b. Click the link (or verify its path) to ensure it correctly navigates to `_documentation/README.md`.
5. Review the entire `README.md` for clarity, coherence, and professional presentation.
6. Ensure that any pre-existing content in the `README.md` has been preserved and the new sections are logically placed.
7. Check for any broken links or formatting issues.
8. If rendered (e.g., on a Git platform), check that the Markdown formatting is correct and readable.
