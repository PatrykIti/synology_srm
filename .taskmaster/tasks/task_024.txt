# Task ID: 24
# Title: Enhance Documentation Template with Navigation Links
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 23
# Priority: high
# Description: Update the `TEMPLATE.MD` to include standardized navigation sections at the top and bottom. These sections will feature a link back to the main table of contents (`../README.md`) and placeholders for links to the previous and next documents in the documentation sequence.
# Details:
1. Locate and modify the `TEMPLATE.MD` file, which is the standard documentation template established in Task 2.
2. Add a navigation bar at the very top of the `TEMPLATE.MD` structure. This bar should contain:
    a. The literal link: `[← Powrót do spisu treści](../README.md)`. This link is intended to point to the central `README.md` file created in Task 23, assuming generated documents will reside in subdirectories.
    b. A placeholder for the 'previous document' link, formatted as: `[← Poprzedni dokument](PLACEHOLDER_PREVIOUS.md)`.
    c. A placeholder for the 'next document' link, formatted as: `[Następny dokument →](PLACEHOLDER_NEXT.md)`.
3. Add an identical navigation bar at the very bottom of the `TEMPLATE.MD` structure.
4. Ensure these navigation elements are clearly separated from the main content, for example, by using Markdown horizontal rules (`---`) above and below each navigation bar.
5. The placeholders (`PLACEHOLDER_PREVIOUS.md`, `PLACEHOLDER_NEXT.md`) are indicative and should be designed for easy identification and replacement with actual relative file paths when individual documents are finalized and their sequence within the documentation set is determined.

# Test Strategy:
1. Retrieve the `TEMPLATE.MD` file after modifications.
2. Verify that a navigation bar containing the specified three link structures (Table of Contents, Previous, Next) is present at the very top of the template content.
3. Verify that an identical navigation bar is present at the very bottom of the template content.
4. Confirm that the link `[← Powrót do spisu treści](../README.md)` is implemented exactly as specified in both navigation bars.
5. Check for the presence of clear and distinct placeholders for 'previous document' (e.g., `[← Poprzedni dokument](PLACEHOLDER_PREVIOUS.md)`) and 'next document' (e.g., `[Następny dokument →](PLACEHOLDER_NEXT.md)`) links in both navigation bars.
6. Create a test Markdown document using the updated `TEMPLATE.MD` and place it in a hypothetical subdirectory structure (e.g., `_documentation/sample_component/test_doc.md`). Open this test document in a Markdown previewer and confirm that the `../README.md` link correctly resolves or would resolve to `_documentation/README.md`.
7. Assess if the placeholder mechanism for previous/next links is straightforward for future replacement with actual document links.
