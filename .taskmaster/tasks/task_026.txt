# Task ID: 26
# Title: Detailed Analysis and Documentation Update for /usr Directory, Focusing on Synology Components
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Perform a detailed analysis and update documentation for the /usr directory, including its subdirectories like /usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib, /usr/share, and especially /usr/syno. Utilize subagents, Zen MCP, and Gemini for deep inspection of Synology-specific components.
# Details:
The primary goal is to produce comprehensive and updated documentation for the /usr directory, with a strong emphasis on identifying and detailing Synology-specific components, particularly within /usr/syno or other relevant paths. This task builds upon the general analysis outlined in Task 11.

Methodology:
1.  Utilize analysis tools: MCP Zen, Gemini Pro, and specialized subagents (custom scripts or targeted tools for specific data extraction from /usr, especially /usr/syno).
2.  For standard /usr subdirectories (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib, /usr/share):
    a.  Identify key user applications, non-essential system administration binaries, shared libraries, and architecture-independent data files.
    b.  Document their purpose, versions (if discernible), dependencies, and any SRM-specific configurations or usage patterns. Leverage methodologies from Tasks 7, 8, and 9 where applicable.
3.  For /usr/syno (and any other identified Synology-specific directories within /usr):
    a.  Conduct deep analysis to identify proprietary binaries, libraries, helper scripts, configuration files, and data formats.
    b.  Determine the precise functionality of these components and their role in delivering Synology-specific features on the SRM device.
    c.  Map their interdependencies and how they interact with other parts of the system (e.g., kernel, other services, configuration files in /etc).
4.  General analysis techniques to be employed include: `file` command for type identification, `strings` for embedded text, `ldd` for shared library dependencies, `readelf` or `objdump` for ELF file details, and manual analysis of scripts.

Documentation Output:
1.  All documentation must adhere to the standard template defined in Task 2.
2.  Update and expand upon the existing /usr documentation (potentially initiated by Task 11) or create new, detailed sections if Task 11 was only an overview.
3.  Provide clear, detailed descriptions of Synology-specific components found: their purpose, how they are launched or invoked, any specific configuration parameters they use, and the data they consume or produce.
4.  Include relevant security considerations for key components within /usr, especially custom or Synology-provided binaries and services.

# Test Strategy:
1.  Review the updated documentation for the /usr directory to ensure completeness and accuracy.
2.  Verify that all specified subdirectories (/usr/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/lib, /usr/share) have been analyzed and documented appropriately.
3.  Critically examine the documentation for /usr/syno (and other Synology-specific areas). Confirm that Synology components are clearly identified, their functions are well-explained, and their interactions with the broader system are detailed.
4.  Assess whether the use of subagents, MCP Zen, and Gemini Pro is reflected in the depth, detail, and accuracy of the analysis, especially for complex or proprietary components.
5.  Ensure strict adherence to the standard documentation template (Task 2).
6.  Validate the technical accuracy of all documented information, including file paths, component names, versions, dependencies, and described functionalities.
7.  Confirm that the updated documentation for /usr integrates seamlessly with or appropriately references the general /usr documentation framework (potentially from Task 11).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup Analysis Environment and Perform Initial /usr Directory Scan [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure and prepare analysis tools (MCP Zen, Gemini Pro, subagents/scripts). Conduct an initial high-level scan of the entire /usr directory to map its structure, identify major subdirectories, and get a preliminary list of Synology-specific areas beyond /usr/syno.
### Details:
1. Install/configure MCP Zen and ensure Gemini Pro access is available.
2. Develop or gather basic subagent scripts for recursive file listing (e.g., `ls -laR`), type identification (`file` command), and disk usage analysis (`du -sh`) across the /usr directory.
3. Execute initial scans: `tree /usr` (if available, or simulate with find/ls), `ls -laR /usr > usr_listing.txt`, `du -sh /usr/* > usr_sizes.txt`.
4. Review scan outputs to understand the overall structure, size of subdirectories, and identify any potential Synology-specific directories within /usr apart from the known /usr/syno.
5. Document the initial findings and the list of tools prepared for subsequent tasks.

### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Perform in-depth analysis of executables located in /usr/bin (user applications) and /usr/sbin (system administration binaries). Identify their purpose, versions (if discernible), dependencies, and any SRM-specific configurations or usage patterns.
### Details:
1. For each key binary identified in /usr/bin and /usr/sbin:
   a. Use `file` command to confirm its type (e.g., ELF 32-bit LSB executable).
   b. Use `strings` command to extract embedded text, looking for usage instructions, version strings, or configuration file paths.
   c. Use `ldd` command to list shared library dependencies.
   d. Use `readelf` or `objdump` for detailed ELF analysis (e.g., sections, symbols, entry point).
   e. If SRM has a package manager, attempt to cross-reference binaries with package information.
2. Leverage analysis methodologies from Tasks 7, 8, and 9 (if applicable and defined) for identifying purpose, versions, dependencies, and SRM-specific configurations or usage patterns.
3. Utilize MCP Zen and Gemini Pro to gain deeper insights into the functionality of less common or potentially customized binaries and their role within the SRM environment.

### Details:
1. For /usr/lib:
   a. Identify key shared libraries (.so files) and their versions.
   b. Use `ldd` outputs from Subtask 2 (analysis of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin) to understand which libraries are actively used by system and user applications.

2. For /usr/share:
   a. Categorize the types of data found (e.g., documentation, man pages, locale files, zoneinfo, application-specific resources like icons, themes, default configurations, scripts).
   b. Identify any unusually large data sets or directories that might indicate custom Synology content.
   c. Look for Synology-specific branding, default configurations, helper scripts, or data files used by SRM features.
3. Leverage analysis methodologies from Tasks 7, 8, and 9 (if applicable and defined) for documenting purpose, versions, and dependencies.

### Dependencies: 26.1
### Description: Perform a comprehensive deep analysis of the /usr/syno directory and any other Synology-specific directories or files identified within /usr (from Subtask 1). Focus on proprietary binaries, libraries, helper scripts, configuration files, and data formats. Determine their precise functionality, interdependencies, and their role in delivering Synology-specific features on the SRM device.
### Details:
1. Systematically explore the entire /usr/syno directory structure (e.g., /usr/syno/bin, /usr/syno/sbin, /usr/syno/lib, /usr/syno/etc, /usr/syno/share, /usr/syno/чего-нибудь-еще) and any other Synology-specific paths identified in Subtask 1.

   a. Apply analysis techniques: `file`, `strings`, `ldd`, `readelf`/`objdump`.
   b. Manually analyze scripts (shell, Python, Perl, etc.) to understand their logic and interactions.
   c. If proprietary configuration or data formats are encountered, attempt to understand their structure. Develop specialized subagents (custom scripts) if necessary for parsing or extracting meaningful information.
3. Map interdependencies: How are these components launched or invoked? What other system parts do they interact with (e.g., kernel modules, services in /etc/init.d or systemd, other Synology components, configuration files in /etc or /etc/synoinfo.conf)?
4. Utilize MCP Zen and Gemini Pro extensively for understanding the purpose and behavior of proprietary components, their role in specific SRM features (e.g., Safe Access, Threat Prevention, VPN Plus Server), and how they integrate into the overall system architecture.
5. Document the precise functionality, launch mechanisms, key configuration parameters, data consumed/produced, and interactions for each significant Synology-specific component.
