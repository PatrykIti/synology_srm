# Task ID: 9
# Title: Analyze and Document /lib and /lib64 Directories (System Libraries)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Analyze and document shared system libraries in /lib and /lib64, identifying key libraries, their versions, dependencies, and their role in supporting system binaries and services.
# Details:
Identify critical shared libraries (e.g., libc.so, libm.so, libpthread.so, libssl.so, libcrypto.so, and any SRM-specific libraries). Use MCP Zen tools, `file`, `strings`, and `objdump` or `readelf` to inspect libraries. Document their purpose, version (if discernible), and primary executables/services that depend on them. Note any security implications of specific library versions (e.g., known vulnerabilities). Follow the standard documentation template (Task 2).

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation for key libraries. Check for accuracy in versioning (if available) and dependency information. Ensure security notes on critical libraries like OpenSSL are included. Adherence to template.
