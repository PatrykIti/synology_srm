# Title: Analyze and Document /mnt Directory (Mount Points)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: low
# Description: Document the purpose of the /mnt directory and typical mount points used by SRM, such as for external storage devices.
# Details:
Explain the conventional role of /mnt as a temporary mount point for filesystems. Document any standard subdirectories within /mnt that SRM might use for automatically or manually mounted external storage (e.g., USB drives). Follow the standard documentation template (Task 2).

# Test Strategy:

### Details:
Research and document the standard, conventional use of the /mnt directory in Linux/Unix-like systems. Focus on its historical and common role as a temporary mount point for filesystems by system administrators.

## 2. Document SRM-Specific Utilization of /mnt [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Document any standard subdirectories or specific ways SRM utilizes /mnt for automatically or manually mounted external storage (e.g., USB drives).
### Details:
Investigate and document how Synology Router Manager (SRM) specifically uses the /mnt directory. This includes identifying any standard subdirectories created or used by SRM under /mnt, and detailing the processes for how external storage devices (like USB drives) are automatically or manually mounted and accessed via /mnt within the SRM environment.
