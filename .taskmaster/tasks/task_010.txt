# Task ID: 10
# Title: Analyze and Document /libexec Directory (Library Executables)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze executables in /libexec that are not meant to be executed directly by users but are called by other programs or services. Document their function and interaction.
# Details:
Identify executables within /libexec. For each, determine its purpose and which parent programs or services call it. This might require analyzing scripts or configurations in /etc or /usr that invoke these helpers. Use MCP Zen tools and `strings` to understand functionality. Document their role in the system. Follow the standard documentation template (Task 2).

# Test Strategy:
Ensure the role and callers of these executables are clearly documented. Verify accuracy and adherence to the template.
