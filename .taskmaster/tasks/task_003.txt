# Task ID: 3
# Title: Analyze and Document /etc Directory (Active System Configuration)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Deep analysis of the /etc directory has been performed, and documentation for active system configuration files is largely complete. Key areas covered include network settings (DHCP, routing, WiFi), firewall and security (including identified vulnerabilities like DoS disabled and plaintext passwords), system services (SSH, logging, web server), authentication (PAM, AppArmor), and startup scripts (Upstart, rc scripts). The documentation adheres to the defined template.
# Details:
Accessed the srm_backup /etc folder and systematically analyzed files and subdirectories using MCP Zen tools with Gemini Pro. Documentation for /etc has been created, covering purpose, syntax, parameters, and security implications for configuration files. Key areas analyzed include network configuration, firewall rules, service configurations (SSH, logging, web server), authentication mechanisms (PAM, AppArmor), startup scripts (Upstart, rc scripts), and system-wide settings. Security implications, including critical findings, have been documented. The documentation adheres to the template from Task 2 and cross-references with network services (Task 6) and security analysis (Task 5). The analysis of relationships with /etc.defaults will be handled as part of Task 4.

# Test Strategy:
Final review of the generated /etc documentation for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to the template. Confirm that all significant files in /etc, as identified during the analysis, are covered and that security implications (including critical findings) are clearly noted. The cross-check with /etc.defaults documentation will be part of Task 4.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Network Configuration in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Conduct a detailed analysis of network configuration files within /etc (interfaces, DNS, routing). Document findings using the standard template, including a thorough assessment of security implications.
### Details:
Focus on files like /etc/network/interfaces, /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/hosts, /etc/nsswitch.conf, and configurations related to network routes.

Network configuration analysis completed. Findings:
- DHCP client on usbnet0 (192.168.42.172/24)
- DHCP server on lbr0 (192.168.1.0/24) and gbr0 (192.168.2.0/24)
- Multi-WAN setup with policy-based routing
- VPN passthrough enabled for all protocols
- CRITICAL: DoS protection disabled
- CRITICAL: WiFi passwords in plaintext (PatrykITI: Cosik007Pc@)

## 2. Analyze Firewall Rules in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform an in-depth analysis of firewall rules (e.g., iptables, nftables) configured via files in /etc. Document the ruleset, its logic, and default policies using the standard template, and evaluate associated security implications.
### Details:
Identify active firewall system (iptables, nftables, ufw, firewalld), locate rule files (e.g., /etc/sysconfig/iptables, /etc/iptables/rules.v4, /etc/nftables.conf, /etc/ufw/, /etc/firewalld/), analyze rule logic, default policies, and logging.

## 3. Analyze Core Service Configurations in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze configurations for essential system services (e.g., SSH, NTP, cron, syslog) located in /etc. Document each service's configuration using the standard template and assess potential security implications.
### Details:
Examine files such as /etc/ssh/sshd_config, /etc/ntp.conf or /etc/chrony/chrony.conf, /etc/crontab and files in /etc/cron.*, /etc/rsyslog.conf or /etc/syslog-ng/syslog-ng.conf.

## 4. Analyze Authentication and Authorization Configs in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Investigate and analyze authentication mechanisms (e.g., PAM, SSSD, LDAP clients) and authorization settings (e.g., sudoers, group policies) within /etc. Document findings per the template and evaluate security implications.
### Details:
Focus on /etc/pam.d/, /etc/nsswitch.conf, /etc/sssd/sssd.conf, /etc/ldap.conf, /etc/sudoers, /etc/sudoers.d/, /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/group, /etc/security/access.conf.

## 5. Analyze Web Server and UI Related Configs in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze configuration files for web servers (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and any UI-related components managed through /etc. Document settings using the standard template and assess their security implications.
### Details:
Look for directories like /etc/apache2/, /etc/nginx/, /etc/httpd/, and other web application specific configurations if present in /etc (e.g., Tomcat server.xml if symlinked or included from /etc).

## 6. Analyze Other Critical System-Wide Settings in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Identify and analyze other critical system-wide configurations in /etc not covered in previous tasks (e.g., kernel parameters, system limits, filesystem mounts, shared resources). Document these configurations per template and evaluate security implications.
### Details:
Includes files like /etc/sysctl.conf, /etc/security/limits.conf, /etc/fstab, /etc/exports, /etc/modprobe.d/, /etc/issue, /etc/motd, /etc/login.defs, /etc/environment.

## 7. Analyze Scripts and Startup Items in /etc [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and analyze scripts (e.g., init scripts, rc.local, systemd unit files or overrides) and other startup items located in /etc. Document their functionality and assess security implications using the standard template.
### Details:
Examine contents of /etc/init.d/, /etc/rc?.d/ symlinks, /etc/rc.local, /etc/profile, /etc/bash.bashrc, /etc/profile.d/, and systemd unit files or overrides in /etc/systemd/system/ and /etc/systemd/user/.
