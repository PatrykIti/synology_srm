# Task ID: 23
# Title: Create Central README.md in _documentation/ and Remove _TASK_LIST.md
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 22
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the _TASK_LIST.md file in the _documentation/ directory with a new README.md. This new file will provide an overview of the documentation structure and include links to detailed documentation for each system component or directory.
# Details:
1. Navigate to the `_documentation/` directory.
2. Delete the `_TASK_LIST.md` file.
3. Create a new file named `README.md` within the `_documentation/` directory.
4. Populate `_documentation/README.md` with the following sections:
    a. **Introduction**: Briefly describe the purpose and scope of the overall SRM documentation set.
    b. **Documentation Structure**: Explain how the documentation is organized (e.g., by system directory, by component, etc.).
    c. **Directory Documentation Links**: Provide a list of direct links to the primary documentation file (e.g., `README.md` or main document) for each major documented directory or component. Example format: `[Documentation for /etc](./etc/README.md)`. Ensure these links point to the finalized documentation artifacts from Task 22.
    d. **Note**: Briefly mention that this README.md replaces the former `_TASK_LIST.md`.
5. Ensure all links are functional and relative paths are used where appropriate.
6. Use clear, concise language and maintain a professional tone, consistent with other documentation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify that the `_documentation/_TASK_LIST.md` file has been successfully removed.
2. Confirm that the `_documentation/README.md` file has been created in the specified location.
3. Review the content of `_documentation/README.md`:
    a. Check for an accurate and informative introduction and a clear explanation of the documentation structure.
    b. Verify that the list of links to per-directory/component documentation is present, comprehensive, and correctly formatted.
    c. Test each link to ensure it navigates to the correct and existing documentation file and that there are no broken links.
    d. Confirm the note regarding the replacement of `_TASK_LIST.md` is present.
4. Ensure the overall presentation of the README.md is clear, well-organized, and effectively guides users in navigating the documentation set.
