# Task ID: 8
# Title: Analyze and Document /bin Directory (System Binaries)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: medium
# Description: Analyze and document standard system binaries and executables in /bin, detailing their purpose, usage, and any SRM-specific behaviors.
# Details:
Similar to /sbin analysis (Task 7), but for /bin which typically contains essential user command-line utilities. Use MCP Zen tools, `file`, `strings`, `ldd`. Document purpose, common options, and any SRM-specific aspects. Examples: shell (sh, bash), core utilities (ls, cp, mv, grep). Follow the standard documentation template (Task 2).

# Test Strategy:
Review documentation for accuracy. Ensure essential user-level system binaries are documented. Adherence to template.
