Product Requirements Document: Synology SRM System Documentation Project

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Create comprehensive, professional documentation for the Synology SRM (Synology Router Manager) system by performing deep analysis of every component, directory, and file within the srm_backup folder. The documentation must be consistent, thorough, and follow best practices for documenting complex systems.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Perform exhaustive analysis of the entire SRM system structure
2. Create detailed documentation for each major component
3. Ensure absolute consistency across all documentation files
4. Identify and document security implications
5. Map system architecture and component relationships
6. Document network services and integration points
7. Provide maintenance and operational insights

SCOPE:
- Complete analysis of /srm_backup directory and all subdirectories
- All configuration files, scripts, and executables
- System libraries and dependencies
- Network services and daemons
- Security components and implications
- Integration points between components

DELIVERABLES:
1. Structured documentation for each major directory:
   - /bin - System binaries and executables
   - /data - Application data and vendor components
   - /etc.defaults - Default configuration templates
   - /etc - Active system configuration
   - /ini - Initialization and configuration files
   - /initrd - Initial RAM disk components
   - /lib and /lib64 - System libraries
   - /libexec - Library executables
   - /mnt - Mount points
   - /root - Root user directory
   - /run - Runtime data
   - /sbin - System administration binaries
   - /usr - User programs and libraries
   - /var.defaults and /var - Variable data
   - /volume1 - Volume-specific data

2. Cross-component relationship documentation
3. Security analysis report
4. Network services inventory
5. Configuration management guide
6. System architecture diagrams (descriptive)

REQUIREMENTS:

Technical Requirements:
- Deep analysis using MCP Zen tools with Gemini Pro
- Task management through Task Master
- Systematic approach to ensure completeness
- Web search for best practices and standards

Documentation Requirements:
- Consistent structure across all files
- Professional technical writing
- Comprehensive coverage of all components
- Clear categorization and organization
- Security-focused analysis
- Performance considerations
- Maintenance guidelines

Quality Requirements:
- All documentation must follow the same template
- Technical accuracy verified through analysis
- Complete coverage with no gaps
- Cross-references between related components
- Clear and precise language
- Examples where beneficial

METHODOLOGY:
1. Initialize comprehensive task structure in Task Master
2. Break down analysis into epics, stories, and tasks
3. Use Zen MCP tools for deep analysis with high thinking mode
4. Document findings systematically
5. Review and ensure consistency
6. Validate completeness and accuracy

PRIORITIES:
1. System security components and implications
2. Core system configuration (/etc, /etc.defaults)
3. Network services and daemons
4. System libraries and dependencies
5. Runtime and operational components
6. User-space applications and tools

SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Every directory has comprehensive documentation
- All documentation follows identical structure
- Security implications are clearly identified
- Component relationships are mapped
- Documentation is technically accurate
- Professional quality suitable for system administrators
- Complete cross-referencing between components

CONSTRAINTS:
- Must analyze actual system components, not make assumptions
- Documentation must be based on evidence from files
- Security analysis must be thorough but responsible
- Performance implications should be noted where relevant

TIMELINE:
This is a comprehensive project requiring:
- Initial setup and planning
- Systematic analysis of each component
- Documentation creation and refinement
- Review and consistency checks
- Final validation and completion

END GOAL:
A complete, professional documentation set that allows anyone to understand the Synology SRM system architecture, configuration, security model, and operational characteristics. The documentation should serve as a definitive reference for system administrators, security analysts, and developers working with SRM systems.
