# Directory `srm_backup/lib/`

The `srm_backup/lib/` directory in the Synology SRM system plays a crucial role in storing shared libraries and kernel modules essential for the proper functioning of the operating system and installed applications. These libraries provide reusable code for various programs, which helps reduce the size of executable files and manage memory more efficiently.

## General Purpose

The main purpose of the `/lib` directory (and its counterpart in the backup, `srm_backup/lib/`) is to serve as a central repository for:

*   **Shared Libraries (`.so`):** These are files containing compiled code of functions that can be used by multiple programs simultaneously. Examples include standard C libraries ([`libc.so`](srm_backup/lib/libc.so.6:0)), thread handling libraries ([`libpthread.so`](srm_backup/lib/libpthread.so.0:0)), cryptographic libraries ([`libcrypto.so`](srm_backup/lib/libcrypto.so.1.1:0)), network libraries ([`libcurl.so`](srm_backup/lib/libcurl.so.4.7.0:0)), and many other Synology-specific ones ([`libsynocore.so`](srm_backup/lib/libsynocore.so:0)).
*   **Kernel Modules (in the `modules/` subdirectory):** These are pieces of code that can be dynamically loaded into and unloaded from the operating system kernel, extending its functionality. This includes, for example, hardware drivers, file system support, or network protocols.
*   **Firmware (often in the `firmware/` subdirectory):** Firmware files for various hardware components.
*   **Other System Files:** Other auxiliary files related to libraries or system configuration may also be located here.

Unlike a typical structure where modules are organized into subdirectories corresponding to the kernel version (e.g., `4.4.60/kernel/`), in this case, all modules are located directly in `srm_backup/lib/modules/`.

These modules extend the kernel's functionality by adding support for specific hardware, file systems, network protocols, etc. Below are example categories of modules found in this directory, along with representative files and their probable purposes:
