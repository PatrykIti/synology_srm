# `/srm_backup/var.defaults/` Directory Documentation

The `srm_backup/var.defaults/` directory on a Synology SRM device likely contains the default versions of files and directory structures that are typically found in the live `/var` directory or its subdirectories. This serves as a template or a fallback for various system applications and services, ensuring that if runtime configurations in `/var` are missing or corrupted, the system can revert to or initialize with these defaults.

The `/var` directory in Unix-like systems is designated for variable data files. This includes files that are expected to grow in size, such as logs, spool files, and temporary cache files. The `var.defaults` directory mirrors this concept by providing the initial state or blueprint for these variable data structures.

## Directory Structure and Contents

Below is an analysis of the key subdirectories found within `srm_backup/var.defaults/`:

### `cache/`

*   **Purpose:** This directory likely holds default cache structures for various applications. In a live system, `/var/cache` is used to store cached data from applications. The `var.defaults/cache/` would provide the initial empty directories or template cache files.
*   **Contents:** In this backup, the directory is empty, which is expected for default cache templates.

### `dynlib/`

*   **Purpose:** This directory seems to be specific to Synology's dynamic libraries or dynamically loaded modules, particularly for system services. The `defaults` version would contain the pristine state of these modules or their configuration.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **`securityscan/`**: This is a significant subdirectory containing default rules, databases, and localization texts for the Security Scan (or Security Advisor) feature of SRM.
        *   `INFO`: Likely metadata about the security scan rules or engine.
        *   `ruleDB/`: Contains the core database of security rules.
            *   `__init__.py`: Python package indicator.
            *   `DBList.json`, `DBList.json.gpg`: A list of database files, potentially encrypted or signed.
            *   `DBVersion.json`: Version information for the rule database.
            *   `security_scan.so`: A shared object (binary library) likely containing the core logic for the scan engine.
            *   Subdirectories like `DirectoryService/`, `FileService/`, `Malware/`, `Network/`, `PublicAccess/`, `Security/`, `SharedFolder/`, `SystemCheck/`, `Terminal/`, `Update/`, `User/` contain specific Python-based check scripts (e.g., `domainAdminPermCheck.py`, `ftpAnonymousCheck.py`, `binaryCheck.py`, `httpsEnableCheck.py`, `autoBlockEnableCheck.py`, `sshPortCheck.py`, `check_latest_dsm.py`, `disable_guest.py`). These scripts define the logic for various security checks performed by the system.
            *   `User/Password/pwd.list.gz`: A gzipped list, likely of common or weak passwords used for strength checking.
        *   `texts/`: Contains subdirectories for different languages (e.g., `chs/`, `enu/`, `plk/`) with `strings` files for localization of Security Scan messages.

### `empty/`

*   **Purpose:** This directory is typically used by daemons (e.g., `sshd`) that require an empty, unwritable directory for privilege separation. The `var.defaults/empty/` ensures this directory structure is present from a clean state.
*   **Contents:** As expected, this directory is empty.

### `lib/`

*   **Purpose:** In a live system, `/var/lib` stores state information pertaining to particular applications or services. This data persists between invocations of the application and reboots of the system. `var.defaults/lib/` would contain the initial state for these.
*   **Contents:**
    *   **`dpkg/`**: This subdirectory relates to the Debian Package Management system.
        *   `available`: A default list of available packages. In a live system, this file lists all packages known to `dpkg`.
        *   `status`: A default status file for packages. In a live system, this file describes the status of installed packages.
        The presence of these files suggests that some parts of SRM might use `dpkg` or a `dpkg`-like system for package management, and these are the baseline files.

### `log/`

*   **Purpose:** This directory is the default template for log file structures. The live `/var/log` directory contains system and application log files. `var.defaults/log/` would ensure that necessary log directories are created if they don't exist, but it typically wouldn't contain actual log entries.
*   **Contents:** In this backup, the directory is empty, which is standard for default log directory templates. Specific log files are usually created at runtime.

### `packages/`

*   **Purpose:** This directory likely serves as a default placeholder or template structure for installed application packages or their variable data.
*   **Contents:** In this backup, the directory is empty. This suggests that while the directory structure is defined, the default state contains no specific package data templates.

### `services/`

*   **Purpose:** This could be a default location for service-specific variable data or state files, similar to `/var/lib` but perhaps more granularly organized by Synology.
*   **Contents:** In this backup, the directory is empty.

### `spool/`

*   **Purpose:** The `/var/spool` directory holds data that is awaiting some kind of processing (e.g., mail queues, print spools). `var.defaults/spool/` would provide the default structure for these spooling areas.
*   **Contents:** In this backup, the directory is empty. This is typical, as spool files are usually dynamic and created as needed.

## Summary

The `srm_backup/var.defaults/` directory plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and initial state of variable data structures on the Synology SRM device. It primarily contains empty directories or template files that define the expected layout for logs, caches, package data, and system services like the Security Scan. The most complex part is `dynlib/securityscan/`, which houses a comprehensive set of default rules and localization files for SRM's security assessment features.
