# `/mnt/` Directory Documentation

## Purpose

The `/mnt/` directory in Unix-like operating systems, including Synology SRM, is traditionally used as a temporary mount point for filesystems. This means it's a location where storage devices (like USB drives, external hard drives, or network shares) can be attached to the main filesystem hierarchy, making their contents accessible.

## Content within the Backup

In the context of this Synology SRM backup, the `/mnt/` directory is **empty**.

This is an expected state for a system backup. Typically, when a system backup is performed:

*   **Mounted filesystems are not part of the core OS backup:** The backup process usually focuses on the operating system files and configurations themselves. Data residing on separately mounted filesystems (e.g., user data on an external USB drive) would typically be backed up as part of a separate data backup job, not as part of the OS image.
*   **Mount points are just placeholders:** The `/mnt/` directory itself is just a placeholder in the filesystem. When a device is mounted, its filesystem is overlaid at that point, but the original `/mnt/` directory on the root filesystem remains empty.

Therefore, finding an empty `/mnt/` directory in the backup indicates that no filesystems were mounted there *persistently as part of the core OS structure* or that the backup process correctly excluded the contents of any temporarily mounted filesystems at the time of backup.
