*   `SYNO.Core.File.Thumbnail`
*   `SYNO.Core.Package.Installation`
*   `SYNO.Core.QuickConnect`
*   `SYNO.FileStation.VFS.Connection`
*   `usr.bin.httpd` (cached profile for the Apache web server)
*   `usr.share.captiveportal.captiveportal.cgi`
*   `usr.syno.synoman.webapi.entry.cgi`
*   Many `usr.syno.synoman.webfm.*` entries related to File Station CGI scripts.
*   Many `usr.syno.synoman.webman.*` entries related to DSM (DiskStation Manager) web interface CGI scripts.

#### `apparmor.d/httpd/`

| `mac_filter/`  | This subdirectory is likely intended to store MAC address filter lists for `hostapd`. MAC filtering is a security measure to allow or deny specific devices from connecting to the Wi-Fi network based on their MAC addresses. | This directory is **empty** in the default configuration. If MAC filtering were configured, files containing lists of allowed or denied MAC addresses would typically reside here, or the main `hostapd.conf` would point to them. |

### `httpd/`

This directory contains the default configuration files for the Apache HTTP Server (`httpd`), which is used to serve web content, including the SRM management interface.
