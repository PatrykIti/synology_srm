# `/srm_backup/lost+found/`

**Purpose:**

The `lost+found` directory is a standard component of Unix-like file systems, including those used by Synology SRM devices. Its primary purpose is to store recovered data fragments after a file system check (e.g., using the `fsck` utility).

When the file system encounters inconsistencies or corruption, `fsck` attempts to repair it. If `fsck` finds data blocks that are allocated but do not belong to any file (i.e., orphaned file fragments), it can recover these fragments and place them as files in the `lost+found` directory. Each recovered fragment is typically given a numerical name (e.g., `#12345`).

**Content Analysis (2025-06-02):**

Upon examination, the `/srm_backup/lost+found/` directory was found to be **empty**.

This indicates that:
*   The file system from which this backup was taken was likely consistent at the time of the last file system check.
*   No file system corruption issues were detected or repaired that would have resulted in orphaned file fragments being placed here.

The presence of an empty `lost+found` directory is normal for a healthy file system.
