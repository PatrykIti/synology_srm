# `srm_backup/data/` Directory Analysis

The `srm_backup/data/` directory appears to store vendor-specific or module-specific configuration and calibration data for the Synology SRM system.

## Directory Structure

```
srm_backup/data/
└── vendor/
    └── wifi/
        ├── wlfw_cal_01_qcn9000_pci0.bin
        └── wlfw_cal_01.bin
```

## Contents

### `srm_backup/data/`

*   **`vendor/`**: This subdirectory likely contains data provided by or specific to hardware vendors whose components are used in the Synology SRM device.

### `srm_backup/data/vendor/`

*   **`wifi/`**: This subdirectory strongly suggests it holds data related to the Wi-Fi subsystem of the router.

### `srm_backup/data/vendor/wifi/`

*   **`wlfw_cal_01_qcn9000_pci0.bin`**:
    *   **Type**: Binary file (`.bin`)
    *   **Probable Purpose**: Wi-Fi firmware calibration data. The name components suggest:
        *   `wlfw`: Wireless Firmware.
        *   `cal`: Calibration.
        *   `qcn9000`: Likely refers to a Qualcomm Atheros QCN9000 series Wi-Fi chipset (a Wi-Fi 6/6E chipset).
        *   `pci0`: May indicate the specific PCI bus or device instance.
    *   **Function**: This file likely stores hardware-specific calibration data for the Wi-Fi radio, essential for optimal performance, regulatory compliance (e.g., power levels, channel usage), and stability of the wireless network. Such data is often unique to each physical device or batch.

*   **`wlfw_cal_01.bin`**:
    *   **Type**: Binary file (`.bin`)
    *   **Probable Purpose**: General or alternative Wi-Fi firmware calibration data.
    *   **Function**: Similar to the file above, this likely contains calibration data for the Wi-Fi firmware. It might be a more generic calibration file, a calibration for a different radio/band, or a fallback calibration. The `_01` might indicate a version or a primary calibration set.

## Summary

The `srm_backup/data/` directory, through its `vendor/wifi/` path, stores critical binary files that are most likely Wi-Fi firmware calibration data. These files are essential for the correct and optimal operation of the Synology SRM router's wireless functionalities. Losing or corrupting these files could lead to Wi-Fi performance issues or complete Wi-Fi failure. They are a crucial part of the system's low-level hardware configuration.
