i# Synology SRM System Analysis and Documentation Plan

This document outlines a detailed plan for the analysis and documentation of the Synology SRM system, a backup of which is located in the `srm_backup/` directory. The goal is to create a comprehensive knowledge base about the system's structure, functionality, and configuration.

## Phase 1: General Analysis and Structure

*   **Task 1.1: Overview of Main Directories**
    *   **Description:** Detailed analysis of the contents of each main directory in `srm_backup/` (e.g., `bin/`, `data/`, `etc/`, `lib/`, `run/`, `var/`, `var.defaults/`, `usr/`).
    *   **Objective:** To understand the general purpose of each directory and identify key subdirectories/files.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/structure/bin.md`, `_documentation/structure/data.md`, `_documentation/structure/etc.md`, `_documentation/structure/lib.md`, `_documentation/structure/run.md`, `_documentation/structure/var.md`, `_documentation/structure/var_defaults.md`, `_documentation/structure/usr.md` with general descriptions.

*   **Task 1.2: Configuration Files Analysis (etc/)**
    *   **Description:** Detailed review of files in `etc/` and `etc.defaults/`. Pay attention to file formats (e.g., `.conf`, `.ini`, shell scripts) and their interdependencies.
    *   **Objective:** To understand how the system is configured and what the default settings are.
    *   **Outcome:** Expansion of `_documentation/structure/etc.md` with sections on key configuration files.

## Phase 2: System Components and Services

*   **Task 2.1: Binary Files and Scripts Analysis (bin/, sbin/)**
    *   **Description:** Identification of important executable files and scripts in `bin/` and `sbin/`. Attempt to determine their function based on names and, if possible without execution, file headers.
    *   **Objective:** To understand basic system tools and processes.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/components/binaries.md` and `_documentation/components/scripts.md` with descriptions of identified files.

*   **Task 2.2: Libraries Analysis (lib/)**
    *   **Description:** Review of libraries in `lib/`. Identification of known libraries (e.g., `libapr`, `libdbus`, `libpq`) and an attempt to determine their use in the context of SRM.
    *   **Objective:** To understand software dependencies and utilized technologies.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/components/libraries.md`.

*   **Task 2.3: Running Processes Analysis (run/)**
    *   **Description:** Review of PID files and other runtime files in `run/`. Identification of system services (e.g., `crond`, `dhcp-server`, `dnsmasq`, `sshd`, `synoconfd`).
    *   **Objective:** To understand which services are running on the system and how they are managed.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/services/running_processes.md`.

## Phase 3: Security and Network

*   **Task 3.1: Network Rules Analysis (run/access_srm_rules_v4/v6, run/isolate_rules_v4/v6, run/ipset/)**
    *   **Description:** Detailed analysis of files containing firewall rules and IPSet configurations. Understanding how the router manages access, isolation, and NAT.
    *   **Objective:** To understand network security mechanisms and routing.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/security/network_rules.md`.

*   **Task 3.2: Security Scan Analysis (var.defaults/dynlib/securityscan/)**
    *   **Description:** Review of Python scripts in `var.defaults/dynlib/securityscan/ruleDB/`. Analysis of which security aspects are checked (e.g., passwords, FTP configuration, DSM settings, firewall).
    *   **Objective:** To understand built-in security and auditing features.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/security/security_scan.md` with descriptions of individual scanning modules.

## Phase 4: Further Analysis and Details

*   **Task 4.1: Log and Variable Data Analysis (var/)**
    *   **Description:** Review of typical log locations and other variable data in the `var/` directory.
    *   **Objective:** To understand where the system stores information about its operation and errors.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/data/logs_and_runtime.md`.

*   **Task 4.2: Volume Analysis (volume1/)**
    *   **Description:** If `volume1/` contains data, analysis of its structure and content (e.g., installed packages, user data).
    *   **Objective:** To understand how data is stored on the main volume.
    *   **Outcome:** Creation of `_documentation/data/volume_structure.md`.

*   **Task 4.3: System Patterns and Best Practices**
    *   **Description:** Based on the collected information, identification of recurring patterns in file organization, scripts, and configurations.
    *   **Objective:** To understand the design philosophy of Synology SRM.
    *   **Outcome:** Update `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` with identified patterns.

## Phase 5: Synthesis and Maintenance

*   **Task 5.1: Documentation Consolidation**
    *   **Description:** Ensuring that all collected information is consistent and well-organized in the `_documentation/` directory.
    *   **Objective:** To create comprehensive and useful documentation.

*   **Task 5.2: Memory Bank Update**
    *   **Description:** Regular updating of files in `memory-bank/` (especially `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`) as analysis progresses.
    *   **Objective:** To maintain an up-to-date project context.
