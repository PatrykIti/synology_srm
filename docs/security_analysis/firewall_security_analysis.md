# Synology SRM Firewall Security Analysis

## Executive Summary

This security analysis examines the firewall configuration of a Synology SRM device, focusing on VPN passthrough rules and security settings. The analysis reveals several critical security concerns that require immediate attention.

## Current Configuration Overview

### VPN Passthrough Rules
The firewall is configured to allow passthrough for three VPN protocols:

1. **PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol)**
   - TCP Port 1723
   - Protocol 47 (GRE)

2. **IPSec (Internet Protocol Security)**
   - UDP Port 500 (IKE)
   - UDP Port 4500 (NAT-T)
   - Protocol 50 (ESP)
   - Protocol 51 (AH)

3. **L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol)**
   - UDP Port 1701

### Security Settings
- **DoS Protection**: DISABLED (`dos_protect_enable=no`)
- **IPv6 Security**: Identical rules to IPv4 (no IPv6-specific hardening)

## Security Vulnerabilities

### 1. Critical: DoS Protection Disabled
**Risk Level**: HIGH
- The device is vulnerable to various Denial of Service attacks
- No rate limiting or connection throttling
- Susceptible to:
  - SYN flood attacks
  - UDP flood attacks
  - ICMP flood attacks
  - Connection exhaustion

### 2. PPTP Protocol Exposure
**Risk Level**: HIGH
- PPTP is fundamentally insecure and deprecated
- Known vulnerabilities:
  - MS-CHAPv2 authentication can be cracked
  - Weak encryption (MPPE uses RC4)
  - Vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks
  - NSA has confirmed ability to decrypt PPTP traffic

### 3. Broad VPN Passthrough Rules
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- All VPN traffic is allowed through without inspection
- No filtering based on source/destination
- Potential for unauthorized VPN tunnels
- Bypasses application-layer security controls

### 4. L2TP Without IPSec Enforcement
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- L2TP alone provides no encryption
- Port 1701 open without requiring IPSec
- Potential for unencrypted tunnel establishment

### 5. IPv6 Security Gaps
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- No IPv6-specific security rules
- Identical configuration to IPv4 may miss IPv6-specific threats
- No consideration for:
  - IPv6 extension header attacks
  - IPv6 fragmentation attacks
  - Neighbor Discovery Protocol security

### 6. Missing Security Controls
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM
- No evident intrusion detection/prevention
- No geographic IP filtering
- No time-based access controls
- No protocol anomaly detection

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: DoS Attack
An attacker could easily overwhelm the device with:
```
# SYN Flood
hping3 -S --flood -p 80 <target>

# UDP Flood
hping3 --udp --flood -p 500 <target>
```

### Scenario 2: PPTP Exploitation
1. Capture PPTP handshake
2. Crack MS-CHAPv2 hash (can be done in under 24 hours)
3. Decrypt all PPTP traffic

### Scenario 3: Rogue VPN Tunnel
Without source IP restrictions, attackers could:
1. Establish unauthorized VPN connections
2. Bypass perimeter security
3. Access internal network resources

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Enable DoS Protection**
   ```
   dos_protect_enable=yes
   ```

2. **Disable PPTP Completely**
   - Remove PPTP passthrough rules
   - Migrate to secure alternatives (OpenVPN, WireGuard)

3. **Implement Source IP Restrictions**
   ```bash
   # Example: Allow VPN only from specific IPs
   iptables -A VPN_PASSTHROUGH -s <trusted_ip>/32 -j RETURN
   iptables -A VPN_PASSTHROUGH -j DROP
   ```

### Short-term Improvements (1-2 weeks)

1. **Harden IPSec Configuration**
   - Enforce strong encryption (AES-256)
   - Use IKEv2 only
   - Implement DH Group 14 or higher

2. **Add Rate Limiting**
   ```bash
   # Connection rate limiting
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 500 -m limit --limit 10/min -j ACCEPT
   iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 500 -j DROP
   ```

3. **Implement Logging**
   ```bash
   # Log VPN connection attempts
   iptables -A VPN_PASSTHROUGH -j LOG --log-prefix "VPN_ATTEMPT: "
   ```

### Long-term Security Enhancements (1-3 months)

1. **Deploy Modern VPN Solution**
   - WireGuard (preferred for performance)
   - OpenVPN with TLS 1.3
   - Implement certificate-based authentication

2. **IPv6 Security Hardening**
   ```bash
   # IPv6 specific rules
   ip6tables -A INPUT -p ipv6-icmp --icmpv6-type 134 -j DROP  # Block Router Advertisements
   ip6tables -A INPUT -m rt --rt-type 0 -j DROP               # Block routing headers
   ```

3. **Implement IDS/IPS**
   - Deploy Snort or Suricata
   - Configure VPN-specific detection rules
   - Enable automated blocking

4. **Zero Trust Architecture**
   - Implement micro-segmentation
   - Require authentication for all connections
   - Use principle of least privilege

## Compliance Considerations

The current configuration may violate:
- **PCI DSS**: Requirement 1.2.1 (restrict inbound/outbound traffic)
- **HIPAA**: Insufficient encryption for data in transit
- **GDPR**: Inadequate security measures for personal data protection

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   ```bash
   # Nmap VPN detection
   nmap -sU -p 500,1701,4500 --script ike-version <target>
   
   # OpenVAS comprehensive scan
   openvas -T4 <target>
   ```

2. **Penetration Testing**
   - Test VPN authentication bypass
   - Attempt DoS attacks (controlled environment)
   - Verify encryption strength

## Conclusion

The current firewall configuration presents significant security risks, particularly with DoS protection disabled and PPTP enabled. Immediate action is required to address critical vulnerabilities. The recommendations provided should be implemented in phases, with critical items addressed immediately to reduce the attack surface and improve overall security posture.

## Risk Matrix

| Vulnerability | Likelihood | Impact | Risk Score | Priority |
|--------------|------------|--------|------------|----------|
| DoS Protection Disabled | High | High | 9/10 | Critical |
| PPTP Exposure | High | High | 9/10 | Critical |
| Broad VPN Rules | Medium | High | 7/10 | High |
