## Decision

*   **2025-05-30 13:14:14 - Detailed analysis of `srm_backup/bin/` directory.**
    *   **Rationale:** To provide comprehensive documentation of the Synology SRM system backup structure as part of Task 1.1.1. This involves identifying files, their types (executable, symbolic link), and their probable functions.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/bin.md` to house the detailed analysis.
        *   Utilized `list_files` to obtain the actual file list from `srm_backup/bin/`.
        *   Analyzed each identified file (`ash@`, `busybox*`, `cat@`, `catv@`, `chgrp@`, `chmod@`, `chown@`, `cp@`, `date@`, `dd@`, `df@`, `dmesg@`, `dnsdomainname@`, `echo@`, `egrep@`, `false@`, `fgrep@`, `get_key_value@`, `getopt@`, `grep@`, `gunzip@`, `gzip@`, `hostname@`, `ip*`, `ipcalc@`, `jq*`, `kill@`, `killps@`, `ln@`, `login@`, `ls@`, `mkdir@`, `mknod@`, `more@`, `mount@`, `mv@`, `netstat@`, `nice@`, `ntfs-3g*`, `ntfs-3g.probe*`, `pidof@`, `ping@`, `ping6@`, `proxy*`, `ps@`, `pwd@`, `rm@`, `rmdir@`, `run-parts@`, `sed@`, `sh@`, `sleep@`, `stat@`, `stty@`, `su@`, `sync@`, `tar@`, `touch@`, `true@`, `umount@`, `uname@`, `usleep@`, `vi@`, `zcat@`) and described its probable purpose in the Synology SRM context.
        *   Explained the meaning of `@` (symbolic link) and `*` (executable) suffixes.
        *   Translated the entire `_documentation/structure/bin.md` content to English.
        *   Added corresponding entities to the Memory MCP for each file and the directory.

*   **2025-05-30 13:20:41 - Analysis of `srm_backup/data/` directory.**
    *   **Rationale:** To provide comprehensive documentation of the Synology SRM system backup structure as part of Task 1.1.2.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Utilized `list_files` to check the contents of `srm_backup/data/`.
        *   The directory was found to be empty.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/data.md` to document this finding and the probable purpose of the directory.
        *   The documentation was written in English.
        *   Added a corresponding entity to the Memory MCP for the `srm_backup/data/` directory.
