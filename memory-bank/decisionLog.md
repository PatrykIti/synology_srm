2025-05-30 12:47:29 - Log of updates made.

*   **[2025-06-02 12:33] - Analysis and documentation of `srm_backup/run/` directory.**
    *   **Decision:** Analyze the `srm_backup/run/` directory and create corresponding documentation.
    *   **Rationale:** Continue systematic documentation of the SRM backup structure. This directory contains volatile runtime data.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Used `list_files` with `recursive: true` to check the contents of `srm_backup/run/`.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/run.md` explaining the purpose of the directory, common file types (PIDs, locks, sockets), and summarizing the findings from the backup. Emphasized the volatile nature of these files.
        *   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`) are being updated.
*   **[2025-06-02 12:30] - Analysis and documentation of `srm_backup/root/` directory.**
    *   **Decision:** Analyze the `srm_backup/root/` directory and create corresponding documentation.
    *   **Rationale:** Continue systematic documentation of the SRM backup structure. This directory is the home directory for the root user.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Used `list_files` with `recursive: true` to check the contents of `srm_backup/root/`. Found `.profile` and `.wget-hsts`.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/root.md` explaining the purpose of the directory and its contents (`.profile` for shell configuration, `.wget-hsts` for HSTS data used by `wget`).
        *   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`) have been updated.
*   **[2025-06-02 12:27:19] - Analysis and documentation of `srm_backup/mnt/` directory.**
    *   **Decision:** Analyze the `srm_backup/mnt/` directory and create corresponding documentation.
    *   **Rationale:** Continue systematic documentation of the SRM backup structure. This directory is standard in Unix-like systems for temporary mount points.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Used `list_files` to check the contents of `srm_backup/mnt/`. The directory was found to be empty.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/mnt.md` explaining the purpose of the directory, its typical use as a mount point, and noting its empty state in the backup context.
        *   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`) have been updated.
*   **[2025-06-02 12:23] - Analysis and documentation of `srm_backup/lost+found/` directory.**
    *   **Decision:** Analyze the `srm_backup/lost+found/` directory and create corresponding documentation.
    *   **Rationale:** Continue systematic documentation of the SRM backup structure. This directory is standard in Unix-like systems.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Used `list_files` to check the contents of `srm_backup/lost+found/`. The directory was found to be empty.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/lost+found.md` explaining the purpose of the directory and noting its empty state.
        *   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, `decisionLog.md`) are being updated.
*   **[2025-06-02 10:47] - Completion of documentation for `srm_backup/ini/`, `srm_backup/initrd/`, `srm_backup/lib64/`, and `srm_backup/libexec/` directories.**
    *   **Decision:** Sequentially analyze and document these directories based on user confirmation.
    *   **Rationale:** Continue systematic documentation of the SRM backup structure.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/ini.md` for `srm_backup/ini/`.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/initrd.md` for `srm_backup/initrd/` (found to be empty).
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/lib64.md` for `srm_backup/lib64/`.
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/libexec.md` for `srm_backup/libexec/` (found to be empty).
        *   Memory Bank files are being updated to reflect these completions.
*   **[2025-05-31 12:46] - Start of `srm_backup/lib/` analysis after completing `srm_backup/etc.defaults/`.**
    *   **Decision:** Proceed with the analysis of the `srm_backup/lib/` directory as the next step in documenting the Synology SRM structure.
    *   **Rationale:** Analysis of `srm_backup/etc.defaults/` has been completed. According to information from `memory-bank/progress.md` (which should be synchronized with `_documentation/_TASK_LIST.md`), `lib/` (Task 1.1.4) is the next directory to analyze.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   A new sub-task will be created for Architect mode to conduct the analysis of `srm_backup/lib/`.
        *   The results will be saved in `_documentation/structure/lib.md`.
        *   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are currently being updated to reflect this progress.
*   **[2025-05-30 21:05] - Interruption of `srm_backup/etc.defaults/` analysis and delegation of the remaining part.**
    *   **Decision:** The analysis of the `srm_backup/etc.defaults/` directory has been partially completed (up to and including the `nfs/` subdirectory). Due to the large context size and the remaining number of subdirectories, further analysis will be delegated to a new sub-task.
    *   **Rationale:** Maintain a manageable context size for the current task, ensuring efficiency and clarity of work.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Updated `_documentation/structure/etc.defaults.md` with the analyzed subdirectories.
        *   Updated `memory-bank/activeContext.md` and `memory-bank/progress.md` to reflect partial completion and next steps.
        *   Entities in `memory` MCP will be updated for the analyzed elements.
        *   A summary of the work done so far will be prepared.

*   **[2025-05-30 20:37:19] - Analysis of `srm_backup/etc/` (Task 1.1.3).**
    *   **Rationale:** Continuation of documenting the Synology SRM system structure.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Conducted analysis of the contents of the `srm_backup/etc/` directory.
        *   Created/updated documentation in `_documentation/structure/etc.md`.
        *   No new, significant decisions regarding documentation methods or file interpretation were made during this analysis.
## Decision

*   **2025-05-30 13:27:00 - Corrected analysis of `srm_backup/data/` directory (Task 1.1.2 Correction).**
    *   **Rationale:** Initial analysis incorrectly identified `srm_backup/data/` as empty. User feedback indicated the presence of a `vendor/` subdirectory. A re-analysis was required to accurately document the contents.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Used `list_files` tool to investigate `srm_backup/data/vendor/` and subsequently `srm_backup/data/vendor/wifi/`.
        *   Identified `srm_backup/data/vendor/wifi/` containing `wlfw_cal_01_qcn9000_pci0.bin` and `wlfw_cal_01.bin`.
        *   Deduced these files are likely Wi-Fi firmware calibration data.
        *   Updated `_documentation/structure/data.md` with the corrected findings, detailing the path and probable purpose of these files.
        *   The documentation was written in English.
        *   Corresponding entities for the newly found directories and files will be added to Memory MCP.

*   **2025-05-30 13:20:41 - Analysis of `srm_backup/data/` directory.**
    *   **Rationale:** To provide comprehensive documentation of the Synology SRM system backup structure as part of Task 1.1.2.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Utilized `list_files` to check the contents of `srm_backup/data/`.
        *   The directory was found to be empty. (This entry is now superseded by the corrected analysis above)
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/data.md` to document this finding and the probable purpose of the directory.
        *   The documentation was written in English.
        *   Added a corresponding entity to the Memory MCP for the `srm_backup/data/` directory.

*   **2025-05-30 13:14:14 - Detailed analysis of `srm_backup/bin/` directory.**
    *   **Rationale:** To provide comprehensive documentation of the Synology SRM system backup structure as part of Task 1.1.1. This involves identifying files, their types (executable, symbolic link), and their probable functions.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Created `_documentation/structure/bin.md` to house the detailed analysis.
        *   Utilized `list_files` to obtain the actual file list from `srm_backup/bin/`.
        *   Analyzed each identified file (`ash@`, `busybox*`, `cat@`, `catv@`, `chgrp@`, `chmod@`, `chown@`, `cp@`, `date@`, `dd@`, `df@`, `dmesg@`, `dnsdomainname@`, `echo@`, `egrep@`, `false@`, `fgrep@`, `get_key_value@`, `getopt@`, `grep@`, `gunzip@`, `gzip@`, `hostname@`, `ip*`, `ipcalc@`, `jq*`, `kill@`, `killps@`, `ln@`, `login@`, `ls@`, `mkdir@`, `mknod@`, `more@`, `mount@`, `mv@`, `netstat@`, `nice@`, `ntfs-3g*`, `ntfs-3g.probe*`, `pidof@`, `ping@`, `ping6@`, `proxy*`, `ps@`, `pwd@`, `rm@`, `rmdir@`, `run-parts@`, `sed@`, `sh@`, `sleep@`, `stat@`, `stty@`, `su@`, `sync@`, `tar@`, `touch@`, `true@`, `umount@`, `uname@`, `usleep@`, `vi@`, `zcat@`) and described its probable purpose in the Synology SRM context.
        *   Explained the meaning of `@` (symbolic link) and `*` (executable) suffixes.
        *   Translated the entire `_documentation/structure/bin.md` content to English.
        *   Added corresponding entities to the Memory MCP for each file and the directory.
*   **[2025-05-31 12:56] - Completion of `srm_backup/lib/` analysis and planning the next step.**
    *   **Decision:** The analysis of the `srm_backup/lib/` directory is considered complete. The next step will be to consult `_documentation/_TASK_LIST.md` to identify the next directory for analysis.
    *   **Rationale:** Task 1.1.4 has been completed. It is necessary to refer to the main task list to continue systematic documentation.
    *   **Implementation Details:**
        *   Created the file `_documentation/structure/lib.md` with the analysis results.
        *   Memory Bank files (`activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) are currently being updated to reflect this progress.
        *   The next sub-task will involve reading `_documentation/_TASK_LIST.md`.
