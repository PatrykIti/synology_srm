# Project Summary: srm_backup/ Directory Structure Documentation

## 1. Overarching Project Goal:

The primary objective of this project is to create comprehensive and detailed documentation describing the directory structure of `srm_backup/`, originating from a Synology SRM device. This documentation will serve as a reference for understanding the content and organization of files and directories within the system backup.

## 2. General Work Methodology:

The following methodology has been adopted for analysis and documentation:

*   **Sequential Analysis:** The `srm_backup/` directory structure is analyzed directory by directory, in a systematic manner, to ensure completeness.
*   **Tools:** The primary tool used for exploring the file structure is `list_files`, often with the recursive listing option (`recursive: true`) for in-depth examination of subdirectory contents.
*   **Documentation Format:** For each analyzed directory (or group of related directories), a dedicated Markdown file is created. These files are stored in the `_documentation/structure/` directory.
*   **Handling Complex Directories:** In the case of directories with high complexity or a large number of subdirectories (e.g., `srm_backup/lib/`), information may be aggregated in the main documentation file for that directory, using appropriate sections and subsections to maintain readability.
*   **Documenting Empty Directories:** Empty directories are also documented, with an attempt to explain their potential or typical purpose within the Synology SRM system, as far as can be determined from general knowledge of Linux/Unix systems or SRM specifics.
*   **Documentation Language:** All technical documentation created (the content of `.md` files) is prepared in English to ensure its universality and accessibility to a wider audience.
*   **Thought Process Support:** The MCP `sequential-thinking` tool from the `sequential-thinking` server is utilized to structure the analysis process and decision-making.
*   **Context Management (Memory Bank):** After each significant stage of analysis or creation of a substantial part of the documentation, information is saved and updated within the Memory Bank (files: [`productContext.md`](memory-bank/productContext.md:1), [`activeContext.md`](memory-bank/activeContext.md:1), [`progress.md`](memory-bank/progress.md:1), [`decisionLog.md`](memory-bank/decisionLog.md:1), [`systemPatterns.md`](memory-bank/systemPatterns.md:1)) to ensure work continuity and preservation of project context.

## 3. Directories Analyzed So Far:

To date, analysis has been conducted and preliminary documentation created for the following directories within `srm_backup/`:

*   `bin/`
*   `data/`
*   `etc/`
*   `etc.defaults/`
*   `lib/`
*   `ini/`
*   `initrd/`
*   `lib64/`
*   `libexec/`

For each of the above directories, a corresponding `.md` file exists in the `_documentation/structure/` directory.

The above summary outlines the current status of the work and the adopted methodological assumptions in the project of documenting the Synology SRM backup structure.
